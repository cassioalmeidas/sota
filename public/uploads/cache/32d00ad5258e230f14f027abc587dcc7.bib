abstract={This paper introduces a cognitive architecture for a humanoid robot to engage in a proactive, mixed-initiative exploration and manipulation of its environment, where the initiative can originate from both the human and the robot. The framework, based on a biologically-grounded theory of the brain and mind, integrates a reactive interaction engine, a number of state-of-the art perceptual and motor learning algorithms, as well as planning abilities and an autobiographical memory. The architecture as a whole drives the robot behavior to solve the symbol grounding problem, acquire language capabilities, execute goal-oriented behavior, and express a verbal narrative of its own experience in the world. We validate our approach in human-robot interaction experiments with the iCub humanoid robot, showing that the proposed cognitive architecture can be applied in real time within a realistic scenario and that it can be used with naive users.

abstract={In this paper, interaction between humans and robots and for rehabilitation applications in social areas is investigated. People suffering from some disorders require better nursing service for interacting socially. Additionally, utilizing human-robot interaction (HRI), this proposed architecture may be a suitable resolution for problems related to optimizing the focusing and sustaining attention states of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In the near future, it is expected that humanoid robots will have more interactive skills in social regions. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In education, robots have been considered as learning tools. They have evolved from simple tools that only followed students' instructions to complex cognitive artificial systems which allow robots to behave as tutor, peer, or learner. This research proposal suggests the Human-Robot Scaffolding concept as a path to explore new strategies in the learning process which is supported by Bruner's work on scaffold instruction. The expected results foresee the acknowledgement of robots as learning tools which through artificial cognitive conditions can support the mediation process. In this sense, robots will be learning tools that recognize and test the mental models to support schema constructions, influence the zone of proximal development and assist students during their learning process.

abstract={This work presents a novel approach on task oriented control of a humanoid robot through the implementation of a cognitive architecture. The architecture developed here provides humanoid robots with systems that allow them to continuously learn new skills, adapt these skills to new contexts and robustly reproduce new behaviours in dynamical environments. This architecture can be thought of as a first stepping stone upon which to incrementally build more complex cognitive processes, providing this way a minimum degree of intelligence for the humanoid robot. Several experiments are conducted to prove the validity of the system and to test the operation of the architecture. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Future trends in robotics call for robots that can work, interact and collaborate with humans. Developing these kind of robots requires the development of intelligent behaviours. As a minimum standard for behaviours to be considered as intelligent, it is required at least to present the ability to learn skills, represent skill's knowledge and adapt and generate new skills. In this work, a cognitive framework is proposed for learning and adapting models of robot skills knowledge. The proposed framework is meant to allow for an operator to teach and demonstrate the robot the motion of a task skill it must reproduce; to build a knowledge base of the learned skills knowledge allowing for its storage, classification and retrieval; to adapt and generate new models of a skill for compliance with the current task constraints. This framework has been implemented in the humanoid robot HOAP-3 and experimental results show the applicability of the approach. © SAGE Publications Ltd, unless otherwise noted.

abstract={Social HRI requires robots able to use appropriate, adaptive and contingent behaviours to form and maintain engaging social interactions with people. Cognitive Architectures emphasise a generality of mechanism and application, making them an ideal basis for such technical developments. Following the successful first workshop on Cognitive Architectures for HRI at the 2014 HRI conference, this second edition of the workshop focusses specifically on applications to social interaction. The full-day workshop is centred on participant contributions, and structured around a set of questions to provide a common basis of comparison between different assumptions, approaches, mechanisms, and architectures. These contributions will be used to support extensive and structured discussions, with the aim of facilitating the development and application of cognitive architectures to social HRI systems. By attending, we envisage that participants will gain insight into how the consideration of cognitive architectures complements the development of autonomous social robots. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes a procedure to provide a way for the Multilevel Darwinist Brain evolutionary cognitive architecture to be able to learn and preserve procedural knowledge while operating on-line. This procedural knowledge is acquired in the form of ANNs that implement behaviors in the sense of traditional evolutionary robotics. The behaviors are produced in real time as the robot is interacting with the world. It is interesting to see in the results presented that this approach of learning procedural representations instead of exhaustively selecting the appropriate action every instant of time provides better generalization results and more efficient action sequences. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Human consciousness is a target of research in multiple fields of knowledge, that presents it as an important characteristic to better handle complex and diverse situations. Artificial consciousness models have arose, together with theories that attempt to model what we understand about consciousness, in a way that could be implemented an artificial conscious being. The main motivations to study artificial consciousness are related to the creation of agents more similar to human beings, in order to build more efficient machines. This paper presents an experiment using the Global Workspace Theory and the LIDA Model to build a 'conscious' mobile robot in a virtual environment, using the LIDA framework as a implementation of the LIDA Model. The main objective is to evaluate if it is possible to use conscience as implemented by the LIDA framework to simplify decision making processes during navigation of a mobile robot subject to interaction with people, as part of a cicerone robot development. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={A humanoid service robot equipped with a set of simple action skills including navigating, grasping, recognising objects or people, among others, is considered in this paper. By using those skills the robot should complete a voice command expressed in natural language encoding a complex task (defined as the concatenation of a number of those basic skills). As a main feature, no traditional planner has been used to decide skills to be activated, as well as in which sequence. Instead, the SOAR cognitive architecture acts as the reasoner by selecting which action the robot should complete, addressing it towards the goal. Our proposal allows to include new goals for the robot just by adding new skills (without the need to encode new plans). The proposed architecture has been tested on a human-sized humanoid robot, REEM, acting as a general purpose service robot. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},
